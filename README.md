Hi there, this program will take a list of numbered letters and does the following:

* Reads the files
* Arranges the data in numerical order
* Creates a triangular number pyramid
* Extracts the last digit of each row
* Forms a message using the collected data

This program will help you deepen your understanding of programming, and help spies send secret messages, LOL.
